# todo-docker

The purpose of docker-compose is to function as docker cli but to issue multiple commands much more quickly. To make use of docker-compose, you need to encode the commands you were running before into a docker-compose.yml file.
   ```
   -> yum update

   -> yum install docker

   -> yum install docker-compose

   -> `Example: git clone https://github.com/davron112/todo-docker.git /home/docker`

   -> `Example: cd /home/docker`
   
   -> `Example: mkdir /home/projects`
   
   -> `Example: mkdir /home/.data`

   -> cp .env-example .env

   -> docker-compose build

   -> docker-compose up -d

   -> docker-compose ps
```
